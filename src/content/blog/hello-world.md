Welcome to my blog! This is my first post where I share my thoughts on web development and life.

I've been working on this portfolio website and decided to give it a retro Windows 98 theme. It's been a fun project combining modern web technologies with nostalgic design elements.

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- My experiences as a developer
- Projects I'm working on
- Thoughts on technology and coding
- Random musings about life

Stay tuned for more posts!
