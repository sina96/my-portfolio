Greetings reader!

I've been working on this portfolio website and decided to give it a retro Windows 98 theme. The nostalgia vibes hits just right.

Oh yeah, I thought heck, why not add a blog here too. So i might post about:

- Cool projects and gadgets
- Showcasing stuff Linkedin won't like
- Rants about tech or life
- whatever that amuses me atm

See you on the next update!
