#### Meet Grok, your new solution architect!

<br>

I use X daily (don't know why) and i have seen my "for you" page become much slower and weird same goes for the search. Even sometimes with stuck loading screens. I just thought it’s just the Elon curse until Today i stumble upon [this youtube vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8JOlCvA4Qs) that showcased how big companies are using ai agents to make their dream architecture in zero time and clap themselves on the back for making things more ”efficient”. Sounds like my hunch was right.

<br>

Tldr for that video: XAI completely rewrote X's recommendation algorithm, replacing dozens of Java/Scala microservices with four Rust components and a Grok-based transformer. And i’ve heard that twitter search is now basically grok searching using these algorithms. Sounds like Elon is using his beloved Grok to shape his empire. But if you are doing it only for because the agent and benchmarks are saying so, boy you are digging your grave. Because clearly things are not working right atm. Even with everybody’s fav ”Rust” in place.

<br>

I don’t wanna be that old guy screaming at AI but changing system architecture drastically with agents with zero moral ambition is definitely not the way how systems are meant to be built. Sure these agents will get better and fix things, don't get me wrong i've started to use them a lot lately to save time but they are clearly favoring benchmarks and statistics only. In a world where ai is eager to optimize your algorithms, handwritten code and algorithms are getting more and more rare and valuable imo. ”Faster” is not always ”better” and I just hope CEOs would learn this lesson in a less harmful way.

<br>

I was going to send this text to an AI agent and ask them to ”make it look cleaner” but i think i should avoid that for this post ;)

(for the sake of ai not replacing me. I did not write this post, satya did)
